# UAVs for the Environmental Sciences : Methods and applications [[Book]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359619321_UAVs_for_the_Environmental_Sciences)

_Eltner, Anette, Dirk Hoffmeister, Andreas Kaiser, Pierre Karrasch, Lasse Klingbeil, Claudia Stöcker, and Alessio Rovere. UAVs for the Environmental Sciences, 2022._

This repo is a try to consolidate the materials discussed in the book with **hands-on exercises and tutorials** to get going with the practical side of learning about UAVs, and also to mention **useful software** and **further readings**.
